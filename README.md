This React-based app allows users to manage a packing list for trips, adding items, marking them as packed, and deleting items from the list. It dynamically updates statistics about how many items have been packed and how much of the total list is completed.

Components Overview
App Component:

The main component that holds the state of the application, such as the list of items (items).
It renders the logo, form, packing list, and stats components.
Passes necessary data and functions as props to child components like Form, PackingList, and Stats.
Logo Component:

A simple stateless functional component that renders the title of the app: "üå¥ Far Away üíº."
Form Component:

Handles the input for adding new items to the packing list.
Contains two pieces of state:
description: A string that represents the name of the item to add.
quantity: A number that represents the amount of the item.
Submits new items to the App component's state via the setItems function when the form is submitted.
Resets the input fields after submission.
PackingList Component:

Receives the list of items (items) as a prop and renders each item using the Item component.
Passes event handler functions (onTogglePacked, onDelete) for each item to toggle the packed status or delete the item.
Item Component:

Represents an individual item on the packing list.
Displays the item description and quantity.
Includes a checkbox to mark the item as packed/unpacked. Toggling this checkbox invokes the onTogglePacked function passed as a prop.
A delete button (‚ùå) triggers the onDelete function to remove the item from the list.
Stats Component:

Calculates and displays the total number of items, how many have been packed, and the percentage of packed items.
These stats are dynamically updated whenever an item is added, deleted, or toggled as packed/unpacked.
Key Features
State Management:

The items state holds an array of objects representing each item in the packing list.
Each item has an id, description, quantity, and packed (whether the item is packed or not).
useState is used to manage the state of both the list and the input fields.
Adding Items:

Users can add new items to the list by filling out the description and quantity in the Form component and submitting the form.
Each new item is added to the items array with a unique id (generated using Date.now()).
Toggling Packed Status:

The packed/unpacked status of an item can be toggled by clicking the checkbox next to each item.
The handleTogglePacked function updates the packed status of the clicked item without mutating the original array.
Deleting Items:

Items can be removed from the list by clicking the delete button (‚ùå).
The handleDelete function filters out the item with the matching id from the items array.
Dynamic Stats:

The Stats component dynamically calculates and displays:
Total number of items.
Number of packed items.
Percentage of packed items (rounded to the nearest integer).

Technologies Used
React: The entire app is built using React components and hooks (useState).
JavaScript (ES6): Modern JavaScript syntax like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals are used.
CSS: Custom styles are applied via an external stylesheet (index.css).

This app is a basic implementation of a packing list management tool, demonstrating state management and dynamic updates in a simple React app.
